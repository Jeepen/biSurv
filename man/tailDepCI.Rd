\title{Bootstrapped confidence interval for "tail dependence"}
\usage{
tailDepCI(
  formula,
  data,
  q,
  method = "fast",
  tail = "lwr",
  n = 1000,
  level = 0.95,
  type = "normal"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{formula}{a formula object, with the response on the left of a ~
operator, and the terms on the right.  The response must be a
survival object as returned by the \code{Surv} function. The RHS must contain a 'cluster' term}

\item{data}{a data.frame containing the variables in the model}

\item{q}{Quantile to estimate "tail-dependence" for}

\item{method}{How to estimate survival probabilities. Available are 'dabrowska' and 'fast'}

\item{tail}{Tail to estimate "tail dependence" for}

\item{n}{Number of bootstraps}

\item{level}{The confidence level required.}

\item{type}{Type of confidence interval. Available are "normal", which is equal to estimate plus/minus 1.96 times the bootstrap standard error,
and "quantile", which is the empirical quantiles of the bootstrapped estimates.}
