## The package is for bivariate survival data
You can estimate several useful quantities related to bivariate survival data with this package. Concretely a lot of methods for bivariate survival data require an estimate of the bivariate survival function. Three such estimators are available in the function \texttt{biSurv}:

1. Dabrowska: An estimator with the property that its marginals are the Kaplan-Meier estimator. Unfortunately it distributes negative point mass to certain areas - a problem that doesn't go away with increasing sample size.

2. NPMLE: The non-parametric maximum likelihood estimator. MLE is usually a good idea, but in this case it doesn't converge to the truth with continuous data due to how probability mass from singly censored observations is distributed. 

3. Pruitt: Uses a bandwidth to distribute the point mass for singly censored observations nicely. Otherwise similar to NPMLE. Should converge and be "truly" non-parametric if the bandwidth parameter is chosen in such a way that it tends to zero as the sample size increases.
